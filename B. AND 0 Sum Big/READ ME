B. AND 0, Sum Big
2 seconds256 megabytesstandard inputstandard output


Baby Badawy's first words were "AND 0 SUM BIG", so he decided to solve the following problem. Given two integers 𝑛
 and 𝑘
, count the number of arrays of length 𝑛
 such that:

all its elements are integers between 0
 and 2𝑘−1
 (inclusive);
the bitwise AND of all its elements is 0
;
the sum of its elements is as large as possible.
Since the answer can be very large, print its remainder when divided by 109+7
.

Input
The first line contains an integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤10
) — the number of test cases you need to solve.

Each test case consists of a line containing two integers 𝑛
 and 𝑘
 (1≤𝑛≤105
, 1≤𝑘≤20
).

Output
For each test case, print the number of arrays satisfying the conditions. Since the answer can be very large, print its remainder when divided by 109+7
.
